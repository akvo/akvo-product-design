# ADR 004: Include codes in cascade responses

## Context

The uniquenes of a cascade node is sometimes determined by the associated, optional code. This allows partners to easily map a response with an existing administrative ID, for example.
Codes are already supported in the imported CSV files, but are not yet serialized into the SQLite database the app uses for assigning responses.
The goal is to provide both the code and name as part of the node value.

## Decision

The response values are getting more and more complex, and adding new propertie will not scale well.
The decision is to extend the JSON-based schema, and encode complex answers in this packed string.
We will also review the meaning of each *response type*, which will determine the enconding of each value (JSON? string? etc).

Multiple responses (barcodes, option questions, cascades, etc) will be encoded using a **JSON array**.
