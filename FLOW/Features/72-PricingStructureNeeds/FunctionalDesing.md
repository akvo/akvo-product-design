### Overview
The aim is to introduce changes to the system that can help implement the new FLOW pricing structure. 

### Marketing description
A marketing description of this feature.

### Initial features

Backend calculation:
- A way to easily access the number of submitted forms within a timespan
- A way to know how many devices are active in an instance 
- How to get Akvo devices out of the count
- How to get training form submissions out of the count
- How to deal with offline data collection + bulk upload

Front end/UI adjustments to the pricing needs:
- How to inform/notify the users that they are reaching their set limit
  - Who to notify based on users’ roles and permissions  
- Option to provide an overview for the user on their ‘use of FLOW’: How many devices they have active and how many submitted forms per device. This will enable the user to maintain an overview of how they use FLOW and which pricing scale suits them the most
