## Feature definition - 1st implementation step - WORK IN PROGRESS (needs to refelect last design changes) 

Based on the mock ups provided by Kiarii, here is the description of the proposed features and their expected behaviour for the 1st implementation of Webforms, when the webforms are filled in and submitted within the Akvo FLOW dashboard. This implementation does not involve changes into the Data tab. 

### Feature definition 


### Limitations 
- this implementation will not allow to submit a webform for monitoring forms 
- it will be only possible to submit a registration form as a webform
- if there is a Caddisfly question in the form (even if mandatory), the question needs to be disabled (visible but not possible to answer) but it still must be possible to submit the form
