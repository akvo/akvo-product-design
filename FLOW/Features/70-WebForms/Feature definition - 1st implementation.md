## Feature definition - 1st implementation - WORK IN PROGRESS (needs to refelect last design changes) 

Based on the mock ups provided by Kiarii, here is the description of the proposed features and their expected behaviour for the 1st implementation of Webforms, when the webforms are filled in and submitted within the Akvo FLOW dashboard. This implementation involves changes into the Data tab, where we merge the Inspect data tab and the Monitoring tab to create one place for viewing data, submitting webforms and managing workflows. The 3rd implementation will support the submission of a webform via a link.

### Feature definition - Monitored surveys
