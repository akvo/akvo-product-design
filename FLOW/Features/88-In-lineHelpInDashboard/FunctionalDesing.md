### Initial features

**Additional help texts (‘?’ button) on dashboard**

  1. LOCATION: In Survey: Survey basics: Show advanced settings: Choose registration form
    - TEXT ‘?’: With the registration form you fill in the general information that identifies the entity you want to monitor. You fill in the registration form only once, at the beginning of your monitoring. The registration form creates the data point. 


  2. LOCATION: In Survey: Question groups: Repeat question group
    - TEXT ‘?’: Often a number of questions need to be asked multiple times, e.g. when you want to ask the same questions to each member of a household. This function lets you specify that a question group is repeated a number of times during the collection of the data.



  3. LOCATION: In Survey: Add new question: Question type - free text/option/number: Use as data point name 
    - TEXT ‘?’: When checked, the answer to this question will become part of the ‘name’ of the data point. This will be shown in lists on the device, and can be used to search data points. This should only be enabled for one or two questions which will help to identify the data point, such as an id, or a name.


  4. LOCATION: In Survey: Add new question: Question type - geolocation: Use as data point location
    - TEXT ‘?’: When checked, the location captured by this question will be used as the main location of the data point. 


  5. LOCATION: In Survey: Add new question: Free text details/Number: Require double entry of answer in device 
    - TEXT ‘?’: In many cases you want to make sure that the collected information is correct, for example in the case of an email address, phone number or identification number, where it is easy to make mistakes when typing. Requiring the same answer to be entered twice ensures it is verified. 


  6. LOCATION: In Survey: Add new question: Question type - Cascase: Use as data point name 
    - TEXT ‘?’: When checked, the answer to this question will become part of the ‘name’ of the data point. This will be shown in lists on the device, and can be used to search data points. This should only be enabled for one or two questions which will help to identify the data point, such as an id, or a name.


  7. LOCATION: In Survey: Add new question: Cascade: Choose cascade resource 
    - TEXT ‘?’: Choose a pre-created cascade from the Cascade resources library. If you want to create a new cascade, you can create and publish it in the Cascade resources under the Data tab. 


  8. LOCATION: In Survey: Add new question: Date 
    - TEXT ‘?’: The date format is DD-MM-YYYY. 


  9. LOCATION: In Survey: Add new question: Geographic shape 
    - TEXT ‘?’: A geographic shape can be a point, a line or a polygon which you mark on the map. This question type enables you to map a set of points, a certain area, or lines, and view that information as a layer on the map. It is useful if you want to map out an area such as a group of water taps, walking paths, a protected forest, a palm oil plantation or an urban area. 


  10. LOCATION: In Devices: IMEI 
    - TEXT ‘?’: The IMEI is the identifying number unique to each device that helps to identify it in our Akvo database. IMEI stands for International Mobile Station Equipment Identity number.
