# Akvo DASH narrative

## Akvo DASH – open data dashboard, visualization and mashup service

Akvo DASH will provide easy-to-use data mashup, visualization and dashboard services, using your own data and curated data. It will provide unprecedented insight into what works and what doesn’t in international development cooperation. This will prove to be groundbreaking due to its openness and ease-of-use, all in a sustainable business model.

Akvo has flourished since it was founded in 2008, creating several well received internet data services which are seeing unprecedented uptake in the international development sector.

Akvo Really Simple Reporting – In use by 2,500 projects to visualize and report on US$ 1.1 billion in program budgets by 2,400 partners.

Akvo FLOW – Mobile phone based data collection used by over 226 organizations, including UNICEF, WSP, MWA, and a dozen governments in Africa and Asia. At the moment nearly 100,000 forms per month are submitted on average.

Akvo Openaid – The biggest IATI search engine and data repository with 732,000 activities from 21,000 organizations encompassing US$ 1.1 trillion in program budgets.

The data that these services contain can be game-changing. Combined with other data, data about: population, health, school attendance, income levels, environment, investments and more, it can be used to steer program implementation in short iteration cycles, inform policy discussions and decisions, as well as show what works and what doesn’t in international development.

One of the most credible and wide-ranging assessments of international development to date is Roger Ridell’s Does Foreign Development Aid Really Work?*, which found no conclusive evidence either way in response to the question posed in the title. This is clearly unacceptable both in the face of the global challenges which we face, which will hit the poor hardest, as well as considering the size of the funds spent on international development yearly.

This is where Akvo DASH comes in. Easily take data from the Akvo services, overlay it with other data, visualize and map the data. An unprecedented opportunity exists to dramatically improve the outcomes from international development efforts.

The result will be an open source tool, run as an online service, that is user-friendly, well-supported and affordable, with advanced analytical tools and map displays. It will be easy to integrate in organizations’ systems and websites.

The product will be self-service with excellent online documentation. An extensive support team will be put in place to help partner organizations roll out the system rapidly.

## Akvo DASH in 1 minute

Akvo DASH will be a system to easily bring in your own data, combine it with other data, and with a few clicks of a button present: maps, graphs, visualizations and automated reports. Click a few more buttons and you can publish this on your private or public dashboards, under your own brand on your chosen URL.

Akvo DASH will allow you to make data driven decisions to steer and direct your organization or the funds you manage. Is the intervention working? Is money being spent wisely? Can we improve what we do, today?

## Akvo DASH brings together four important components:

![PICTURE][Akvo-DASH-DATA]

1. Your own data, which you can easily load onto the system, for example food security data or water point monitoring data from Akvo FLOW.

2. Curated open data sets, including maps, administrative boundaries, data on populations, income distribution, poverty, access to infrastructure, water, sanitation, agriculture, hydrology, disease statistics, geographic data and more. This data will be constantly updated and improved.

3. A data mashup system, with pre-defined templates for common situations, or custom scenarios, and take data from both the curated data sets and your own data to quickly allow you to produce insightful and useful integrated visualizations.

4. A publishing system for data which will allow you to publish the resulting data mashup under your own brand and on your own chosen URL. Publish to a limited audience, or to the world. Any public datasets will also be seen on a central web site, easily made available under an open source license, at your choice.

The Akvo DASH system will be built around open standards, using open data, with open APIs, on top of and released as, open source software. Just like all the other Akvo tools.
